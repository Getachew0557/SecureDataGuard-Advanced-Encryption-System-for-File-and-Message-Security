#SecureDataGuard: Advanced Encryption System for File and Message Security

Project Description:

SecureDataGuard is a robust data security project developed using Java and JFrame for a user-friendly interface. This system implements the Advanced Encryption System (AES) to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of both computer files and personal messages. The project encompasses encryption and decryption functionalities, offering a comprehensive solution for safeguarding sensitive information.

Features:

Encrypt and Decrypt: This project provides seamless encryption and decryption process for various types of data, including PDFs, documents, videos, images, audio files, and text messages.
User-defined Encryption Key: Users can set their own encryption keys, enhancing the security of their data. Decryption requires the correct key for reverting data to its original form.
Multi-purpose Security: SecureDataGuard serves multiple applications, making it a versatile tool for safeguarding personal data and confidential information.

1. File Security:

   Encrypt and decrypt various file formats, including PDFs, videos, images, and audio files.
   Customizable encryption keys for enhanced security.
   Preserve file integrity during the encryption and decryption process.
   Personal Message Protection:

2. Encrypt and decrypt text messages securely.
   No reliance on file extensions; works seamlessly with text-based messages.

3. User-Controlled Encryption Keys:

   Users can set their encryption keys, ensuring only authorized individuals can access the decrypted data.
   Decryption requires the correct encryption key for data retrieval.

4. Multi-Purpose Application:

   Ideal for securing personal data, confidential information, and sensitive messages.
   Versatile tool for individuals seeking robust data protection solutions.
